Final Fantasy XIII resource editor

I have a problem with the auto_yus_us.bin file.
The game does not accept .bin files larger than 256kb with texts.
It will crash during loading from any part of the city of yusnan.

I need to find something to edit the WPD file and remove unused Keys to try to free up space.
This file would need a compression to be less than 256kb.

If anyone has managed to correct this problem, please contact me. I would be super grateful.
